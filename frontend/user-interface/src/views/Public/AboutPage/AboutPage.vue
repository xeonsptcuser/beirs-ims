      The Barangay Alang-Alang E-Blotter System is designed to modernize and streamline the reporting and monitoring of incidents within the barangay. This digital platform empowers residents to submit reports conveniently, track the status of their submissions, and facilitates better record keeping for barangay officials.

With features such as report submission, viewing personal report history, and status updates, the system improves transparency and responsiveness in local governance. The system also ensures data security by requiring user authentication.

This initiative aligns with the barangay's commitment to community safety, accessibility, and efficient public service through the use of technology.
